## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Preliminary fix for a race condition when parsing upnp events. Change to a small timeout before closing the socket after reading data from socket.
	- using a timeout for the content header and reading the expected bytecount is a more stable solution and should be implemented in future releases.
	

### Changed
- Use silent upnp event adapters for default upnp event listener propagation. The use of the verbose option
	during development was used to debug purposes but now we don't want to spam the logger with useless information
	every time we append a listener.

### Added
- Enqueue audio at a given position in the queue instead of just the end
- Asynch device disovery with callback.
- Changelog
- Demo example
- deprecated method to get the underlying upnp device
- utility method in sonos devices to convert a getAlbumUri to a usable URL. 


### Removed
